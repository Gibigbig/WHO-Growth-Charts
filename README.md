# WHO-Growth-Charts
Pediatric Growth charts by WHO to be used by PChart package

PChart: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pchart-updated
or the typescript version: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pchart

Included: DataTypes: Height, Weight, Head Circumference. 

# Reason for creating?
I needed to use the PChart package to generate pediatric growth charts but the datasets are not precompiled. WHO publishes them in excel format. These compiles the Age, L, M, S values easily in male/female and age groups.
